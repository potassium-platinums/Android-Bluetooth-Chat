Android Bluetooth Chat
======================

The project involved creating a communication application with the help of Android SDK on Eclipse IDE.
This application facilitates communication between Bluetooth enabled android devices over short range in a secured manner.

It can be highly beneficial in the areas of emergency such as military units and hospitals where communication is difficult at times. It proves to be quite reliable since this application does not rely on any centralized infrastructure. The range of bluetooth communication depends on the class of bluetooth adapter installed by the manufacturer.
